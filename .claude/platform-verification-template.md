## 🚨 MANDATORY Platform Verification

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation MUST verify the app is runnable on all platforms. No work is complete without platform verification.

### Platform Verification Requirements:
After completing ANY code changes, you MUST run:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Run comprehensive platform verification
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# This automatically verifies:
# ✅ Code formatting and analysis
# ✅ All tests pass with coverage
# ✅ Android configuration (NDK 27.0.12077973, minSdk 23, Firebase setup)
# ✅ iOS configuration (deployment target 13.0+, Firebase setup)  
# ✅ Web build successful
# ✅ Android APK build successful
# ✅ iOS build successful (on macOS)
```

### Platform Verification Standards:
- **Android**: Must build APK successfully with proper Firebase configuration
- **iOS**: Must build on macOS with iOS 13.0+ deployment target
- **Web**: Must build and deploy to build/web successfully
- **Configuration**: All Firebase config files must be present and valid
- **Dependencies**: All platform-specific dependencies must resolve correctly

### If Platform Verification Fails:
1. **Read the error message carefully** - quality-check.sh provides specific fixes
2. **Check Firebase configuration** - ensure placeholder files haven't been corrupted
3. **Verify platform requirements** - NDK versions, SDK versions, deployment targets
4. **Run flutter clean && flutter pub get** if dependency issues occur
5. **Consult docs/firebase_setup.md** for configuration guidance

### Agent Handoff Platform Check:
When handing off to another agent, include platform verification status:

```markdown
**HANDOFF TO [NEXT-AGENT]:**
- **Completed**: [Your implementation details]
- **Platform Verification**: ✅ PASSED - All platforms build successfully
- **Next Required**: [What the next agent needs to do]
- **Context**: [Important implementation details]
- **Files Modified**: [List of files created/changed]
- **Testing Status**: [What tests are written/needed]
```

### Quality Gate:
**NO IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE UNTIL**:
1. ✅ Platform verification passes (`./scripts/quality-check.sh`)
2. ✅ All platforms (Web, Android, iOS) build successfully
3. ✅ All tests pass with proper coverage
4. ✅ Code analysis shows no critical issues

**Failure to verify platforms will result in broken deployments and blocked development for other team members.**
